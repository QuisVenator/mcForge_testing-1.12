### Testing Mod

## Don't use

  This mod currently has no real use and even the master branch will contain many bugs.
  Everying in here is solely for testing purposes!
  
## What this mod adds

  No idea. Whatever I'm currently learning how to implement.
  
  At the point of writing there have been implemented:
  
    -A recipe that allows inventory crafting with used items (repairing)
    -Custom creative tab
    -Custom crafting table
    -New machine (furnace with 2 slots)
    -Custom gui
    -Item that has custom attack damage (not based on material like sword)
    -Glass blocks
    -Custom machine recipes
    -Intercept event for sword that only works correctly with enough levels


## What ~~might~~ *hopefully will* be implemented in the future

  Obviously this depends on my free time, depression and coffee supply
  
    -Fluid management
    -Energy powered machines
    -Chunk loader
    -Generators
    -Multiblocks
    -**MAYBE!** vehicles
    -Projectiles
    -Custom models (priority at the time of writing)
    -Custom modeled items
    -Custom animations
    -Custom armor models
    -**MAYBE!** some movement modifying stuff (faster run, float, jetpacks,... the cool stuff)
    
    
### WARNINGS:

  I **really** suck at coding. I have no idea what Java code should be. Some of this code was written drunk at 3:00AM. You shouldn't look   at this if you value your eyes!
